							<h1>My Passion in IT</h1>
								<p>
									<h2>Reason</h2>
									<p style="list-style-type:none; text-align:justify;"> 
											As a kid, I had always been curious about how different things work, how the human body works, how old is the universe.
											We are living in an era where we heavily relied on technology to satisfy and helps us in our daily life.
											However, technology and how they work have never been something that interests me as a child, partly might be because it was too complicated for the brain of a young adolescent like me to understand.</br>
										</br>
											When I start the IGCSE ICT class in grade 9, it never hit me off as something appealing.
											It is not until Iâ€™m in grade 10 when I started to learn about basic HTML coding and turtle graphics, that it becomes clear to me how mesmerizing the world of technology can be.
											I was fascinated by how just a few lines of code can create something so intricate and exquisite, and I become absorbed in learning more about this subject.
											The A's I received in the IGCSE test in ICT and Mathematics also a huge motivation for me to choose IT as my major in University.</br>
										</br>
											Another driving force for me to follow this path is through various YouTube videos and channels about IT and engineering topics I watch over the years.
											The channel Code Bullet is my biggest inspiration that led me to become attracted to the concept of artificial intelligence.
											And the further I research about AI, the more mesmerized I became with this concept and their accomplishments in improving human life.
									</p>
									<h2>Why I choose RMIT</h2>
									<p>
										There are many reasons why I choose to study here at RMIT:
										<ol>
											<li>RMIT is one of the best international universities in Vietnam.</li>
											<li>The school offers excellent facilities and services that students can use when needed.</li>
											<li>The international environment is also a great opportunity for me to become friends with people that have different backgrounds than me and share our experiences with each other.</li>
											<li>The exchange and transfer programs that allow students to study abroad in different countries, this can help me to gain more knowledge about the foreign IT industry.</li>
											<li>The transfer program will also give me an internship opportunity in developed countries with advance technology.</li>
										</ol>
									</p>
									<h2>My expectation of RMIT</h2>
									<p style="list-style-type:none; text-align:justify;">I hope that the time I spend studying at RMIT can help prepare me for the working world.
									I want to develop both my hard skills and soft skills ability in order to have effective teamwork with other people.
									I would also like to learn more about coding in different languages and how I can successfully code a program that works with little to no bugs.
									I also want to know more about AI, about the industry and AI application in daily life, and that I'll be able to find a suitable career path in the vast AI world.</p>

									<h1>My Dream Job</h1>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										Google has been the dream of many students studying in the IT major and relative majors, and I'm not an exception. 
										Because of my interest in AI and machine learning, I want to become a software engineering that specializes in these fields, especially the development of new AI. </br>
										<h3> Job description:</h3>
										I have always been fascinated by how just from lines of code can create AIs, a program that is so intelligent that they can help us solve problems that might take a long time to crack. 
										Therefore, I want to be a part of the artificial intelligence development team and be able to contribute to the process.</br>
										<h3> Job requirement:</h3>
										Base on Google's description, I would need to have an MS or Ph.D. degree in computer science or a related field. 
										I also need to have at least 2 years of working or educational experience with AI and at least 1 year of work in a relevant field, for example as a software developer. 
										Knowing numerous programming languages and having experience with many technical skills are preferable in the field.</br>
										<h3> Plan to archive this goal:</h3>
										I am still new to programming and only have some experience with HTML and Python. 
										Therefore, I'm planning to self-taught myself more programming languages in addition to the languages I'll learn in university.
										I'll will strive to advance the skills and knowledge I already have with both HTML and Python.
										Moreover, I want to have some basic experience with coding an AI. Therefore, I want to make some small project for me to get to know more about AI and their process.
										And because the job require at least 1 year of working experience, I want to begin with applying and working as a software engineering first to gain more experience, knowledge, and insight.
										Hence I intend to apply for an internship in some good company during my transfer time in Australia through the Flagship internship course RMIT offer in year 3.
										I hope that through the internship I can improve my hard skills and soft skills, and acquire seniors' advices in the workplace.

									<h2>I'm a Mediator</h2>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
									I think that the test result is quite accurate. However, I would consider myself more of an ambivert, which is a mixture of both introvert and extrovert, instead of an introvert. 
									Because the result show is relatively precise, I don't think it will have any influence when I'm working in a team. 
									As a Mediator, I believe I can work harmoniously with my teammates to reach our goal. I am very flexible with work and wound not mind changes during the working process. 
									I think that can work with a lot of people with different personalities. However, I think that it would be better if I can work with people with Analysts or Sentinels mindset. 
									The reason behind this is because I can often be carried away with work and striving for the result that might be out-of-reach with the skills I have now. 
									People with a logical or practical mindset will be able to stop me from overwork the team and myself.

									My curiosity is also high, which is 
									However, the test shows that I have low persistence, complexity and paradox, which might be true in some case.
									For persistence, I can be quite unmotivated when it come to the thing that I don't like to do. But that does not mean I will give up if I think it is too hard, and I can self-motivate myself into doing the workload.

							<h2>Future Project Idea</h2>
							<p>
							<h3>Overview:</h3>
							My idea for the project is to create an RPG game using Unity. 
							In this game, the main character is an orphan boy who lives in a world full of Dlaejm. He lives in an orphan home in a small village deep in the forest. 
							One day, while playing in the forest, the village was attacked by these creatures and his family got killed by them. 
							Out of rage, he swore revenge toward the Dlaejm. Later on, he is taken in by the Grand Master of Yakstuque (a kingdom nearby). 
							Under the Grand Master teaching, the main character starts to train as a knight. You as the player will control him through the training and mission he will receive. 
							Through the mission, you will discover the secret of the Dlaejm. 
							What to do with it will be your decision, and these decisions can affect the course of the story.</br>
							</br>
							<h3>Motivation:</h3>
							I choose to make an RPG game because I believe this project can be a stepping stone for me to understand more about coding. 
							I personally think that the process of making the game an RPG requires a lot of skills in different areas, 
							from writing the plot to crating the sprite to coding the control of the movement of characters and the interaction between objects, programming a complete working game can be very challenging. 
							However, I like to challenge myself and through this project, I can have more insight into programming in general. The skills we acquire through this project might become helpful in the future. 
							Moreover, I think that this project can be a fun and enjoyable experience for the team. For people who enjoy making game or just playing it, the process of story development and character creating can be very exciting. 
							People in a group can share there idea with each other, from that we can design a world from our own imagination.</br>
							</br>
							<h3>Description:</h3>
							
							</br>
							<h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
							I going to use Unity to make this game. Mainly because it is a famous program that is widely used by many game maker around the world. 
							Moreover, there are a personal free version of this program, which mean it is accessible for everyone in the team.</br>
							
							</br>
							<h3>Skills Required:</h3>
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
								<li> Script/Plot Writing: It serves as the "big picture" of the game. It will be a description of the game and a summary of the main events in the game. 
								Moreover, it also likes a plan so that the team knows what to do next. In my opinion, a good game doesnâ€™t necessarily need a good storyline, it should well-organized first before anything else.</li></br>
								<li> Character/Sprite and Background design: The character as well as the background will most like be in pixelated form. 
								Therefore, it would be easier to do and take less time to design, this can give the team more time to work on other thing</li></br>
								<li> Stage Design: </li></br>
								<li> Menu/Setting/Inventory Design: </li></br>
								<li> Movement controls: </li></br>
								<li> Menu/Setting/Inventory controls:</li></br>
								<li> Music arrangement: </li>
							</ul>
							</br>
							<h3>Outcome:</h3>
